# Drawing 3D spheres for fun

This piece of code draws spheres in a 3D image. It's purpose is to exhibt how to use `Cython` to speed up `Python` code and interact with `numpy` arraies.

## Build the module

When using the code for the first time, run

```sh
./build.sh
```

to build the module `draw`, so that one can `import draw` in a python script

## Use the code

Please see the tiny jupyter notebook
